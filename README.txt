This is a JavaFX application that simulates a logic puzzle game called MathDoku.

Rules of the Game:
A player needs to fill the cells in an NxN square grid with the numbers 1 to N 
(one number per cell), while adhering to the following constraints:

Each number must appear exactly once in each row.
Each number must appear exactly once in each column.
Furthermore, there are groups of adjacent cells called cages, which are highlighted
 on the grid by thicker boundaries. Within each cage is a label showing a target 
number followed by an arithmetic operator (+, -, x, รท). There is an additional 
constraint associated with these cages:

It must be possible to obtain the target by applying the arithmetic operator to the 
numbers in that cage. For - and รท, this can be done in any order.
Note: If a cage consists of a single cell, then no arithmetic operator is shown. 
The label simply shows the number that must be in that cell.
